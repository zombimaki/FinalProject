        <h1>Random Forest Predictive Model</h1>
        <p class="tab">Understanding which neighborhoods will experience crime is critical for public safety.  Forecasting where crime is most likely to occur enables police to concentrate their limited resources in the neighborhoods that need it most.  This approach used two Random Forest models designed to identify the most impactful features impacting crime incidents neighborhoods.   The first model used all 87 Minneapolis neighborhoods.  The second focused on the Downtown West neighborhood which historically has the highest incidents of crime every year and is consistently red on the incident heatmaps reflected on this website. </p>
        <br><p class="tab">Due to the categorial nature of the data in the models, two years (2018-2019) of data and 37,380 crime records were analyzed.

          <p>The results of the model had a low accuracy.  The training data accounted for 57% of the variation, but when the model was applied to the testing data, the score was only 12%.</p>

            <p>The top six features are reflected below descending by order of importance.  As in the first model, Day, Month, Day of Week, and Offense (Theft - UCR Code 7) were impactful.  This model also showed the the time period of 1 AM was impactful.</p>
